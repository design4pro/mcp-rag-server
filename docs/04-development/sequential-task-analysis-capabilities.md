# Sequential Task Analysis Capabilities in MCP RAG Server

## Overview

The MCP RAG Server provides comprehensive tools for sequential task analysis before execution. These capabilities enable systematic breakdown and understanding of complex tasks through multiple reasoning approaches.

## Available Analysis Tools

### 1. Advanced Query Understanding
**Tool**: `mcp_rag_advanced_query_understanding`

**Purpose**: Deep semantic analysis of task queries
- Identifies entities and relationships
- Determines reasoning type and complexity
- Extracts semantic features and roles
- Provides confidence scoring

**Use Case**: Initial task decomposition and understanding

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Tool**: `mcp_rag_chain_of_thought_reasoning`

**Purpose**: Step-by-step logical reasoning
- Breaks down complex tasks into sequential steps
- Provides deductive reasoning at each step
- Maintains reasoning chain with confidence levels
- Configurable number of reasoning steps

**Use Case**: Detailed task analysis with logical progression

### 3. Multi-Hop Reasoning
**Tool**: `mcp_rag_multi_hop_reasoning`

**Purpose**: Multi-stage reasoning with context building
- Performs iterative reasoning across multiple hops
- Builds context progressively
- Maintains plan validity throughout hops
- Provides comprehensive final context

**Use Case**: Complex task planning with iterative refinement

### 4. Context Analysis
**Tool**: `mcp_rag_analyze_context`

**Purpose**: Contextual understanding of tasks
- Analyzes task context and requirements
- Identifies relevant background information
- Provides contextual insights for task execution

**Use Case**: Understanding task environment and constraints

### 5. Memory-Enhanced Analysis
**Tool**: `mcp_rag_get_enhanced_memory_context`

**Purpose**: Leverages user memory for task analysis
- Incorporates historical context and patterns
- Provides personalized task understanding
- Enhances analysis with user-specific insights

**Use Case**: Personalized task analysis based on user history

## Sequential Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Understanding
1. **Query Analysis**: Use `advanced_query_understanding` to decompose the task
2. **Context Extraction**: Analyze relevant context using `analyze_context`
3. **Memory Integration**: Incorporate user memory context

### Phase 2: Task Planning
1. **Chain-of-Thought**: Break down task into logical steps
2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Iteratively refine the plan
3. **Context Validation**: Ensure plan aligns with available context

### Phase 3: Execution Preparation
1. **Resource Identification**: Determine required resources
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task dependencies
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential challenges
