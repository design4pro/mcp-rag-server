# Project Phases Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all phases in the MCP RAG server project. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, creating a robust and feature-rich system.

## Phase Status Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Progress | Priority |
|-------|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Foundations | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% | High |
| 2 | RAG Core | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% | High |
| 3 | MCP Integration | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% | Medium |
| 4 | Memory Integration | üîÑ In Progress | 25% | Medium |
| 5 | Advanced Features | ‚è≥ Pending | 0% | Low |

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundations ‚úÖ Complete
**Location**: [[phase1-foundations|Phase 1 Documentation]]

**Overview**: Established the foundational infrastructure for the MCP RAG server project, setting up the core development environment and basic services.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Python project setup with proper dependencies
- ‚úÖ Basic MCP server implementation using FastMCP
- ‚úÖ Google Gemini API service implementation
- ‚úÖ Basic Qdrant service implementation with Docker deployment

**Dependencies**: None (foundational)

### Phase 2: RAG Core ‚úÖ Complete
**Location**: [[phase2-rag-core|Phase 2 Documentation]]

**Overview**: Implemented the core RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality, building upon the foundational services established in Phase 1.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Document processing pipeline with chunking and preprocessing
- ‚úÖ Vector embedding generation using Gemini API
- ‚úÖ Qdrant collection management and vector storage
- ‚úÖ RAG query pipeline with context retrieval and response generation

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Foundational services)

### Phase 3: MCP Integration ‚úÖ Complete
**Location**: [[phase3-mcp-integration|Phase 3 Documentation]]

**Overview**: Implemented comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, providing tools and resources for document management, search operations, and memory handling.

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Document management tools (add, delete, get, list, stats)
- ‚úÖ Search and query tools (search, ask_question, batch_search)
- ‚úÖ Memory management tools (add, get, delete, clear, context)
- ‚úÖ Data access resources for documents and memories
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation and error handling

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Foundational services), Phase 2 (RAG core functionality)

### Phase 4: Memory Integration üîÑ In Progress
**Location**: [[phase4-memory-integration|Phase 4 Documentation]]

**Overview**: Implementing comprehensive memory integration for the MCP RAG server, enhancing the system's ability to maintain context across conversations.

**Current Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Basic mem0 service integration (25% complete)
- ‚úÖ Memory storage infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Basic memory CRUD operations
- üîÑ Memory-aware RAG queries (In Progress)
- ‚è≥ User session management (Pending)
- ‚è≥ Advanced memory context retrieval (Pending)

**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ‚è≥ Pending
**Location**: [[phase5-advanced-features|Phase 5 Documentation]]

**Overview**: Advanced features, performance optimization, and comprehensive monitoring for the MCP RAG server.

**Planned Features**:
- ‚è≥ Advanced document processing (multi-format, OCR)
- ‚è≥ Advanced search features (facets, clustering, analytics)
- ‚è≥ Performance monitoring and dashboards
- ‚è≥ Production features (load balancing, security, backup)

**Dependencies**: All previous phases

## Development Workflow

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase is considered complete when:
1. **Functional Requirements**: All planned features implemented and tested
2. **Technical Requirements**: Code quality, testing, and documentation standards met
3. **Integration Requirements**: Proper integration with existing components
4. **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive documentation updated

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1 (Foundations)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (RAG Core)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3 (MCP Integration)
    ‚Üì
Phase 4 (Memory Integration)
    ‚Üì
Phase 5 (Advanced Features)
```

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All code must pass review
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests passing
- **Documentation**: Documentation updated and reviewed
- **Performance**: Performance benchmarks met
- **Security**: Security review completed

## Current Focus: Phase 4

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Memory-Aware RAG Queries**: Integrate memory context into RAG processing
2. **User Session Management**: Implement session tracking and persistence
3. **Advanced Memory Context Retrieval**: Enhanced memory relevance and scoring

### Success Metrics
- [ ] RAG queries consider user memory context
- [ ] User sessions are properly managed and persisted
- [ ] Memory operations are performant (< 100ms for context retrieval)
- [ ] Memory relevance scoring provides meaningful results

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core memory integration
- **Week 2**: Session management
- **Week 3**: Advanced features
- **Week 4**: Testing and documentation

## Documentation Structure

### Phase-Specific Documentation
Each phase has its own documentation folder with:
- `README.md`: Comprehensive phase overview
- `implementation-plan.md`: Detailed implementation plan (where applicable)
- `technical-specs.md`: Technical specifications (where applicable)
- `testing-guide.md`: Testing procedures (where applicable)

### Cross-References
All documentation uses Obsidian-style cross-references:
- `[[filename]]` for internal links
- `[[filename#section]]` for section-specific links
- `[[filename|display text]]` for custom display text

## Maintenance and Updates

### Documentation Updates
- Update phase documentation after each significant change
- Maintain cross-references between related documents
- Keep status and progress information current
- Add lessons learned and best practices

### Version Control
- All documentation is version controlled with code
- Documentation changes are committed with related code changes
- Maintain documentation history for reference

## Future Considerations

### Phase 6+ Planning
While not currently planned, future phases could include:
- **Phase 6**: Multi-modal support (images, audio, video)
- **Phase 7**: Advanced AI features (reasoning, planning)
- **Phase 8**: Enterprise features (multi-tenancy, advanced security)

### Scalability Planning
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Plan for multi-region deployment
- Consider microservices architecture evolution
- Prepare for cloud-native deployment
