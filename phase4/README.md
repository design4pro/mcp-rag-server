# Phase 4: Memory Integration

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on implementing comprehensive memory integration for the MCP RAG server, building upon the foundation established in Phase 3. This phase will enhance the system's ability to maintain context across conversations and provide more personalized responses.

## Current Status: 25% Complete

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Basic mem0 service integration
- [x] Memory storage infrastructure
- [x] Basic memory CRUD operations

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Memory-aware RAG queries
- [ ] User session management
- [ ] Advanced memory context retrieval

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Memory-based conversation flow
- [ ] Memory persistence and recovery
- [ ] Memory analytics and insights
- [ ] Performance optimization for memory operations

## Key Objectives

### 1. Memory-Aware RAG Queries
- Integrate memory context into RAG query processing
- Implement memory-enhanced search algorithms
- Add memory relevance scoring

### 2. User Session Management
- Implement user session tracking
- Add session-based memory organization
- Create session persistence mechanisms

### 3. Advanced Memory Tools
- Memory context retrieval with relevance scoring
- Memory summarization and compression
- Memory-based conversation flow management
